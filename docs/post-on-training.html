    <h1>On Training</h1>
    In the following I'm trying to destill the essence of term <i>training</i> in order to clarify the concept. 
    Originally the term appeared in shape of the latin verb <i>trahere</i> and initially meant as much as pulling the horses out of the stable for exercise. <br>
    Today the term is used across domains and not only applied to physical exercise but more general to "hands on practice" in a field.
    Therefore I like the succinct definition of training as an <i>Activity that leads to skilled behaviour</i>. <br />
    Take the case of an elite archer. His ability to reliably hit thumb-sized objects from 500 foot is an impressive feat. 
    Viewing such expert performances inspires me. To me flawless and effortless movement is an expression of mastery, in wich a subject blends perfectly into its environment. 

    In my view skilled behaviour is acquired rather then innate. 
    Though we might have natural disposition for some activities, we have to acquire skills by means of training:
    Unlike birds we are not born with the ability to fly. Our physical make up however allows for a specialization in a variety of areas.
    Training is the crucial part in order to manifest our natural capability potentials.
    Not any activity leads to skilled behaviour. For an a action to qualify as training it requires to be 
    <ul>
        <li><b>intentional</b>, i.e the trainee's attention is fully directed to the activity</li>
        <li><b>repeated</b>, i.e. a skill is not acquired by a single training but has to be repeated over and over. </li>
        <li><b>challenging,</b> i.e. our organism seems to respond more to resond to stimuly of high intensity</li>
    </ul>
   
    Training is the intentional, repeated and challenging performance of a particular activity.
    Via adaptation mechanism of its organism the trainee acquires skill in this activity, which is characterised by higher accuracy and efficiency in comparison to untrained subjects.
